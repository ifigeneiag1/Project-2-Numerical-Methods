# Project-2-Numerical-Methods

In this project we show how to approximate the function f(x)=sin(x) using a polynomial expansion, we also examine the special case of using only antisymmetric polynomials. In any case, we also evaluate the error and check for which maximum value of the order of polynomial we achieve the minimum error. 
One of the main goals of the project was to evaluate the coefficients of the expansion that give the best fitting using the Least Squared method employing Linear Algebra to solve for them. 
We also approximate the derivative of our function in two ways and compare them. We see that both of them do not differ very much and both approximate cos(x) well.
